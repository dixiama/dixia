        <h1 id="textcont">Learning about Dyscalculia</h1>
        <p>Dyscalculia is a learning disorder that affects a person’s ability to understand number-based information and math. People who have dyscalculia struggle with numbers and math because their brains don’t process math-related concepts like the brains of people without this disorder. However, their struggles don’t mean they’re less intelligent or less capable than people who don’t have dyscalculia.

            The symptoms of this disorder usually appear in childhood, especially when children learn how to do basic math. However, many adults have dyscalculia and don’t know it. People who have dyscalculia often face mental health issues when they have to do math, such as anxiety, depression and other difficult feelings.
            
            There’s also a form of dyscalculia that appears later in life. This form, acquired dyscalculia, can happen at any age. This usually happens for other reasons like a medical condition (see more about this under the Causes and Symptoms section below).</p>

<p>People who have dyscalculia are neurodivergent. Neurodiversity is a term that describes how no two people have the same brain, and everyone’s brain forms and develops in a completely unique way. For people with dyscalculia, that means their brain works differently from the brain of someone who doesn’t have disorders or conditions that affect how their brain works.

    Solving a math problem like “2+2=?” might seem simple, but it takes several different skills — and the areas of the brain that manage them — working together to do it. </p>

        <p>Children with learning and attention difficulties often have more than one condition. There are several conditions that frequently coexist with dyscalculia. Additionally, the symptoms of certain conditions can sometimes resemble those of dyscalculia, which can make it more difficult to diagnose. Therefore, testing for dyscalculia should be part of a comprehensive evaluation to simultaneously identify any other learning or attention challenges.
            Here are some conditions that often occur alongside dyscalculia:
    </p>
    <h2>Dyslexia</h2>
        <p>It is common for children to have both dyslexia and dyscalculia. In fact, research shows that between 43% and 65% of children with math difficulties also have reading disabilities. This is because both dyslexia and dyscalculia are cognitive processing disorders that affect different areas of the brain, but often share certain challenges, especially in areas of language processing and symbol recognition.
        </p>

    <h2> ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder)
    </h2>
        <p>Dyscalculia and ADHD often occur together. Sometimes, children with ADHD make errors in math due to difficulties with attention to detail or staying focused on tasks. For example, a child may struggle to stay organized or may miss critical steps in a multi-step math problem because they are easily distracted. Some experts recommend reassessing math skills once ADHD symptoms are better managed, as improved focus can help reduce errors.
        </p>

        <h2>Executive Functioning Difficulties
        </h2>
                <p>Executive functions are essential cognitive skills that impact learning. These include working memory, flexible thinking, planning, and organization. Deficiencies in these areas can make math difficult. For example, a child may have trouble remembering math facts or organizing their work, which can interfere with their ability to solve problems effectively.
                </p>

                <h2>Math Anxiety</h2>
                <p>Children with math anxiety experience intense fear or nervousness about doing math, often leading to avoidance or poor performance on math tests. This anxiety can sometimes be mistaken for a lack of ability, but it is more often related to an emotional reaction to the difficulty of math tasks. Some children may have both math anxiety and dyscalculia, further complicating their learning experience.
                </p>

                <h2>How You Can Help Your Child with Dyscalculia
                </h2>
                <p>You play a unique and important role in providing the support and motivation your child needs. From working with the school to developing math skills at home, you can help your child stay motivated to overcome their challenges.
                    Here are some things you can do:
                    Review multisensory math techniques you can use at home.
                    Explore software, apps, and tools that can assist your child with math.
                    Look for free online assistive technology tools for math.
                    Find board games that help develop math skills.
                    Learn ways to help your child build their self-esteem.
                    Read about how your child can advocate for themselves in elementary and middle school.
                    Get recommendations on how to advocate for your child at school.

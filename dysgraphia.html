        <p>Dyslexia and dysgraphia are two distinct neurological conditions, though they’re easy to confuse because they share symptoms and often occur together.

            Dyslexia is a learning difference that makes it harder for people to learn to read. If you have dyslexia, you may read more slowly or have trouble recognizing words. Often, people with dyslexia read at a lower level than expected. People with dyslexia may struggle to break words into sounds or relate letters to sounds when reading.
            
            Dysgraphia involves difficulty with the act of writing. Difficulties can range from issues with physically writing words to issues with organizing and expressing thoughts in written form.</p>
        <p>Dysgraphia is common. Researchers estimate that 5% to 20% of people have dysgraphia. The estimated range is large because dysgraphia often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.</p>
        <p>Typically, early testing is best for learning differences. Your child can learn new writing strategies sooner when dysgraphia is diagnosed early. Depending on how your child is affected by dysgraphia, they may show signs of the condition as early as 5 years old or as late as young adulthood.

            As writing demands in school increase with age, it’s important to diagnose dysgraphia as early as possible. It’s also important to remember that it’s never too late to get a diagnosis and help.
            
            Your child’s school may recommend an evaluation for learning disabilities with a certified educational psychologist. Ask the school administration for help finding one available to you.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, you can’t prevent dysgraphia. But you can manage it by finding different strategies to write.

            Early diagnosis is essential — talk with your child’s healthcare provider if you notice any early signs of dysgraphia. If your child is diagnosed, work with their school to develop an individualized education plan (IEP).</p>
        <p>Be an advocate for your child. You and your child’s school can develop an individualized education plan (IEP). This document sets personalized expectations and lesson plans for your child at school.

            You can also help your child build writing skills at home. Try out pencil grips and other tools that may make writing easier. Look for apps or software that can help with handwriting and graphic organizers that can help with writing assignments.</p>
        <p>If you or your child’s teacher suspects your child has a learning difference like dysgraphia, you can get help. Dysgraphia is a manageable neurological condition. Talk to your child’s healthcare provider, teacher or the school’s administration to discover ways to help your child with their writing skills.
        </p>
        <p>Dysgraphia can affect children and adults. As with many neurodevelopmental conditions, dysgraphia is more common in children assigned male at birth (AMAB) than in children assigned female at birth (AFAB).

            You’re more likely to have dysgraphia if other family members also have it, and dysgraphia is common in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>
   <p>People with dysgraphia often have trouble concentrating on other things while writing. This can make it difficult to take notes during class or a meeting because so much attention is being paid to getting each word down on paper. Other things that are said may be missed.

    Students with dysgraphia may also be accused of being sloppy or lazy because their handwriting isn’t neat. This can affect self-esteem and lead to anxiety, a lack of confidence, and negative attitudes toward school.</p>
   <p>If dysgraphia appears in childhood, it’s usually the result of a problem with orthographic coding. This is an aspect of working memory that allows you to permanently remember written words, and the way your hands or fingers must move to write those words.

    With dysgraphia, kids or adults have a harder time planning and executing the writing of sentences, words, and even individual letters. It’s not that you don’t know how to read, spell, or identify letters and words. Instead, your brain has problems processing words and writing.
    
    When dysgraphia develops in adults, the cause is usually a stroke or other brain injury. In particular, injury to the brain’s left parietal lobe may lead to dysgraphia. You have a right and left parietal lobe in the upper part of your brain. Each is associated with a range of skills, such as reading and writing, as well as sensory processing, including pain, heat, and cold.</p>

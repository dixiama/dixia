        <h1>Learning about Dyslexia</h1>
        <p>The key symptoms of dyslexia are problems with decoding or reading individual words and/or poor fluency in reading and spelling. Phonological weaknesses or disorders, as well as specific language-based difficulties, are generally the underlying cause of the literacy problems associated with dyslexia. Comprehension can be affected, and writing skills will suffer if spelling is not mastered. Language and vocabulary issues can cause comprehension difficulties that may worsen over time as academic demands increase. Struggling readers may have a weak vocabulary and background knowledge due to reading less than average readers.        </p>
        <p> The problems associated with dyslexia are language-based, not visual, and are not related to cognitive skills or intelligence. Phonological processing problems are the main cause of dyslexia. Phonological processing refers to the ability to analyze speech or spoken language, from identifying individual words to parts of words or syllables, down to the smallest components called phonemes or speech sounds. Since speech is produced quickly and the sounds within spoken words are pronounced rapidly, phonemes overlap. Some people may experience difficulty with rapid automatic naming, which can exacerbate the challenge of learning to read. Phonemes or speech sounds can vary depending on geographic region or the individual, and they are often quite difficult to distinguish. An assessment conducted by a trained professional can determine if the student has difficulties with phonological processing.</p>
        <p>Mathematics assessment may be conducted as part of a comprehensive educational evaluation and should include measures of untimed math calculations, math reasoning with math problems read aloud, and math fluency. Many students with language-based learning disabilities or dyslexia struggle to memorize language-based information, such as multiplication tables, but may have adequate skills in math calculations and reasoning when reading accommodations (math problems read aloud) are provided. Other students may struggle with math language and have difficulty with math problems that go beyond decoding issues. A trained clinician can analyze the student's strengths and weaknesses in mathematics, considering the student's performance on each subtest, rather than relying solely on general math scores that provide only an average of subtest scores. For example, students who have average skills in untimed math calculations and average math reasoning (math problems read aloud), may have weak math fluency. In this case, students need additional time to accommodate their demonstrated weak math fluency. General math scores that report the average of all subtests may mask individual weak areas. A careful analysis of the student's performance on educational subtests is needed for a clinical evaluation of learning needs. This will lead to appropriate and necessary recommendations for remediation and accommodation.  </p>
        <p>A number of techniques are available to visualize the anatomy and function of the brain. A commonly used tool is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which creates images that can reveal information about brain anatomy (e.g., the amount of gray and white matter, the integrity of white matter), brain metabolites (chemicals used in the brain for communication between brain cells), and brain function (where large concentrations of neurons are active). Functional MRI (fMRI) is based on the physiological principle that brain activity (where neurons are "firing") is associated with increased blood flow to that specific part of the brain. The MRI signal communicates direct information about increases in blood flow. From this signal, researchers infer the localization and amount of activity associated with a particular task, such as reading isolated words, that participants are performing during the study. The data from these studies are typically collected from groups of people, not individuals, for research purposes only, meaning they are not used to diagnose dyslexia in individuals.
        </p>
        <p>Since reading is a cultural invention that emerged after the evolution of modern humans, there is no single location in the brain that serves as a "reading center." Rather, brain regions that help with other functions, such as spoken language or object recognition, are not specific to reading but are repurposed for reading (Dehaene & Cohen, 2007). Reading involves multiple cognitive processes, two of which have been of particular interest to researchers: 1) mapping or graphic representations of grapheme-morphemes, where letter combinations (graphemes) are paired with corresponding sounds and words are "decoded," and 2) visual recognition of the form of words to make graphic representations (mapping) of these words with the corresponding mental representation. Together, these processes allow us to pronounce words and derive meaning. According to these cognitive processes, studies in both adults and children have shown that reading is based on a network of regions in the left hemisphere, including the occipital, temporal, and inferior frontal cortices. The occipital cortex contains the area related to the visual form of words. Both the parietal cortex and the inferior frontal cortex play roles in the phonological and semantic processing of words, and the inferior temporal cortex is also involved in the formation of speech sounds. These areas have been shown to change as we age and are altered in individuals with dyslexia.
        </p>
        <p>Initially, evidence of a connection between dyslexia and brain structure was found when the anatomy of the brains of deceased adults who had dyslexia in life was examined. The asymmetry observed in the left temporal lobe, which was larger than its right hemisphere counterpart, was not observed in these brains. Additionally, ectopias (displacement of brain tissue to the surface of the brain) were found. Researchers began using MRI to look for structural images in the brains of volunteers with and without dyslexia. Current imaging techniques have revealed a smaller volume of gray and white matter, as well as altered integrity in the white matter of the occipital and parietal areas of the left hemisphere. Researchers are still investigating how these changes are influenced by a person’s language and writing systems.
            Initial functional studies were limited to adults because they used invasive techniques requiring radioactive materials. The field of brain mapping has been greatly benefited by the invention of functional MRIs (fMRI). fMRI does not require the use of radioactive markers, so it is safe for both children and adults and can be used repeatedly, which facilitates longitudinal studies on development and intervention. First used to study dyslexia in 1996, fMRI has since been widely used to study the role of the brain in reading and its components (phonology, spelling, and semantics). Studies from different countries have coincided in their findings on altered areas in the left hemisphere, specifically the occipital, parietal, and inferior frontal cortices (and their connections). The results of these studies confirm the universality of dyslexia across different languages.
            </p>
            <p>Dyslexia is associated with various genetic variants, and the impact of these variants has been studied both in humans and mice. Using animals that have been bred to carry genes associated with dyslexia, researchers are studying how these genes may affect the development of brain areas and communication between them.
                These studies align with research in humans. Differences in brain anatomy and brain function have been observed in people with genes associated with dyslexia, even in those with good reading skills. In addition to anatomical, physiological, and molecular research, scientists are trying to determine the chemical connection that exists with dyslexia. For example, brain metabolites that play a role in neuronal communication can be visualized using another MRI-related technique called spectroscopy. It is thought that various metabolites (such as choline) may differ in people with dyslexia. Researchers continue to explore the connection between all these findings, hoping that what they discover will help determine the causes of dyslexia. This is a challenging aspect of research because differences in the brains of people with dyslexia are not necessarily the cause of their reading difficulties (for example, they could also be a consequence of reading less).
